	<h1>XML and Javascript Information</h1>
	<h3>What is XML?</h3>
	<p>XML, which stands for eXtensive Markup Language, is a language that was created to carry and store information. Unlike HTML, it will not display information. Separate programming must still be used.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>How is XML used?</h3>
	<p>XML is used with tags that are made up by the document author, as opposed to HTML which has its own set of predefined tags. Adding, removing, or modifying data is simple in XML, too.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>XML Example:</h3>
	<p>XML would look something like this.</p>

	<h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
	<p>JavaScript is a language that is interpreted by a web browser that utilizes and manipulates objects. This can include the browser's window, the actual document, or elements such as pictures.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>How is JavaScript related to HTML and CSS?</h3>
	<p>JavaScript is related to HTML and CSS in a couple ways. First, Java scripting can be done directly in an HTML or file, or in a separate file like CSS would be. JavaScript also directly manipulates HTML elements such as buttons, forms, windows, images, etc.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Common JavaScript...</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Elements: forms & images</li>
		<li>Properties: properties are created values for an object. For example, object.property</li>
		<li>Methods: methods for JavaScript would be written like <pre>name = person.firstName()</pre></li>
		<li>Functions: Functions are activated when they're invoked, or called. The code to be executed are inside {. It would look like <pre>function name (parameters) {}</pre></li>
	</ul>
